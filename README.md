# VGEM-2018

Virginia iGEM 2018's Code Pitâ„¢

## Getting Started

If you're a member of the team and you'd like to start committing code *and* you've never used Git or Github before, check out the [Gitting Started Guide](https://github.com/Mantissa-23/VGEM-2018/tree/master/.getting_started#1-what-is-this-document), made specifically for members of the Virgina iGEM 2018 team.

If you've used Github and whatnot before, shoot me a message at dtc9bb@virginia.edu and I'll add you as a contributor.

## Who are we?

We're Virginia iGEM! We do stuff with synthetic biology and quorum sensing. We're pretty cool.
