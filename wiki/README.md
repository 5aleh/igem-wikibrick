# Wiki

Contains all HTML, CSS and JS content that will be found on http://2018.igem.org/Team:Virginia.

## Todo

- Create an upload.js script to map and upload files to destinations on the iGEM wiki with igemwiki-api
- Add bower, enabling bootstrap and future packages as managed dependencies
- Use Handlebars to establish local and web builds which correctly manage local/web images, CSS and JS.
