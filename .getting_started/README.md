This is a quick primer, primarily aimed at individuals who have little to no experience with programming on how to use Git and Github. It’s also for programmers who have never used it before, have tried and failed to use it before, or haven’t used it in ages and need a refresher.

For those who have used version control before, or are using it now, or are very confident in their understanding of programming concepts, please look at the official Getting Started guide published by the developers of Git. Additionally, if you have questions or are interested in the more advanced features of Git, feel free to reference this document as it’s quite comprehensive.

If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me a private message in GroupMe or email Dylan Culfogienis at dtc9bb@virginia.edu. Or just, y’know, talk to me, I don’t bite.

# 3 What is Github

    Github is a source code repository hosting and sharing website that makes use of the Git Version Control System (Git VCS). In layman's terms, it’s kinda like Google Drive, but specifically meant for open-source, code-centric software projects that many people will be working on at once. Some projects that are hosted on Github include Linux, the Python programming language, and a majority of the code that makes websites like Facebook, Twitter, Google and Youtube run.

    If you don’t care about how Git/Github works and just want to get work done, just read Section 4, Okay cool, how do I use it. If you’re miffed that you have to learn how to use another damn program and/or are curious about how Git works and why we’re using it, you should probably read Section 5 first, Why don’t we just use Google Drive.
